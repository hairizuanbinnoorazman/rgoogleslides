Description: Previously, when one is working with in the Google Ecosystem (Using Google Drive etc), there is hardly any good workflow of getting the values calculated from R and getting that into Google Slides. The normal and easy way out would be to just copy your work over but when you have a number of analysis to present with a lot of changes between each environment, it just becomes quite cumbersome.
